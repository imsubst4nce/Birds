# **Bird Classification**

### **Description of the project**<br>
This project was implemented for my class **Artificial Intelligence - 4TTV417U** for the spring semester 2022-2023.<br>
I have selected the following dataset to work with. The target is to classify images of several bird species.<br>

* In my first implementation(Birds_CNN) I am using Tensorflow and the pretrained Keras model EfficientNetB0(as an extractor) which hits an avg of 97% accuracy.<br>
* The second implementation(Birds_RF) I am using VGG16 as an extractor and then I pass down the results to a Random Forest.
