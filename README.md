# **Bird Classification using the pretrained model EfficientNetB0**

### **Description of the project**<br>
This project was implemented for my class **Artificial Intelligence - 4TTV417U** for the spring semester 2022-2023.
I have selected the following dataset to work with.
The target is to classify images of several bird species.
In my implementation I am using Tensorflow and the pretrained Keras model EfficientNetB0(as an extractor) which hits an avg of 97% accuracy.
